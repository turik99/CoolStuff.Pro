# CoolStuff.Pro

Cool Stuff is meant to show case my skills as a front end and back end developer. 

Inside you'll see endpoints I wrote to interact with an AWS server, assets I created to theme the website properly and components I wrote to interact with all the data in a composable, clean manner. The project is written in TypeScript with React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the back end
